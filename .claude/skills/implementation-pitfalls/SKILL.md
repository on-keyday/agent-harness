# Implementation pitfalls (project-local failure catalog)

Concrete past misses on this project. Each entry has:
- **What went wrong** — the specific incident with commit refs
- **Why it slipped review** — the mechanism that let it through
- **Mitigation** — what to insert into implementer / reviewer prompts to catch it next time

These are NOT generic best practices — they are this-project trap-pattern documentation derived from incidents on `main`. Read this BEFORE you start dispatching subagents or writing a fresh implementation. They are the most cost-effective additions to your subagent prompts.

---

## Pitfall 1 — Spec scope contraction (problem statement ≠ implementation section)

**What went wrong**: The Phase B spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-22-server-mode-runner-reverse-dial-design.md`) said in the **Problem** section that ALL `harness-cli` subcommands on a runner host suffer from ACL outbound block. But the **Implementation** section was titled "Phase B: Agent leg = objproto negotiated proxy" — and the implementation shipped covering only the `agent` subcommand. User caught it months later: `harness-cli ls` from inside a runner-spawned process silently failed because cli.Dial didn't check the proxy env.

Fixed in commit `2365260` (moved proxy detection into `cli.DialPeerConn`, shared by every subcommand).

**Why it slipped review**: The reviewer subagent compared the diff to the Implementation section only. Spec compliance was technically PASS. The Problem section was never re-read during review.

**Mitigation — insert into IMPLEMENTER prompts:**

> Step 0: read the spec's **Problem statement** verbatim (not the Implementation section alone). In your final report, enumerate the problem-statement bullets and state which ones the diff addresses. If any bullet is left unaddressed, justify the omission explicitly.

**Mitigation — insert into REVIEWER prompts:**

> Read BOTH the spec's Problem statement AND the Implementation section. Flag any problem-statement bullet not covered by the diff. "Spec compliance" review against only the Implementation section misses scope contractions that happen in the spec itself.

---

## Pitfall 2 — Invented labels harden into unwritten constraints

**What went wrong**: The Phase B spec used the label "Agent leg" (which I invented, undefined). The label semantically narrowed the scope from "all harness-cli on runner host" to "agent subcommand", but the narrowing was never written down — the label just felt narrower than the actual problem. User: "agent leg という言葉がそもそも定義がよくわからない".

Same incident as Pitfall 1, same fix (`2365260`).

**Why it slipped review**: A vague label feels rigorous. Reviewers and implementers treat it as authoritative without checking what it actually denotes.

**Mitigation — when writing specs:**

- Describe the concrete mechanism in plain terms, NOT a label
- If a label is unavoidable, state IN/OUT scope explicitly immediately after introducing it
- Beware labels like "X leg", "Y side", "Z axis", "design intent", "state precondition" — these are tells

**Tells of the same pattern** (`feedback_jargon_masks_confusion` in memory): if you find yourself constructing terminology to describe what code SHOULD do, you probably don't fully understand the mechanism yet. Read the code first.

---

## Pitfall 3 — Sibling-code grep skipped, wrong pattern copied

**What went wrong**: When adding the `--via` flag for `server dial-runner` across CLI/TUI/WebUI, the implementer copied the high-level `cli.ServerDialRunner(ctx, server, target, via)` pattern (which does Dial + defer Close — appropriate for the short-lived `harness-cli` binary) into TUI and WebUI. But TUI and WebUI already hold a long-lived `*cli.Client` from snapshot polling; they should have used `cli.ServerDialRunnerWith(ctx, c, ...)` instead. Every `server dial-runner` from TUI/WebUI was opening a fresh WS conn + ECDH + PSK + Hello, throwing away the existing client.

Fixed in `c55ed45` (TUI/WebUI use the `*With` variant on `a.client` / `currentClient()`).

**Why it slipped review**: Implementer's view was confined to the cli helper. The reviewer compared against the spec which said "extend cli.ServerDialRunner" — also literally satisfied. Neither asked "how does DoSubmit / DoCancel call into cli? Should this new caller follow the same pattern?".

**Mitigation — insert into IMPLEMENTER prompts when adding code to TUI/WebUI/server handlers:**

> Step 0: grep how sibling code in this layer calls into the same helper category. Specifically for TUI: every existing Do* function (DoSubmit, DoCancel, DoInteractive, DoSessionList, ...) threads `a.client` through. Your new DoX MUST follow the same pattern, NOT the harness-cli binary's Dial+Close pattern.

**Mitigation — insert into REVIEWER prompts:**

> Does this diff use the same helper-invocation pattern as adjacent code in the same layer? Spec compliance alone is not enough — check layer-internal consistency.

---

## Pitfall 4 — Defensive AND-gating creating silent failures

**What went wrong**: When I just added env-based proxy detection to `cli.DialPeerConn`, I gated it on BOTH `HARNESS_PROXY_VIA_RUNNER` AND `HARNESS_TASK_ID` being set. The rationale was "Phase B requires task_id" — true, but admin-side processes that have `HARNESS_PROXY_VIA_RUNNER` somehow (manual export, env merging, future scenarios) would fall back to direct dial silently instead of erroring. Worse: if `HARNESS_TASK_ID` resolution failed for any reason, the proxy attempt would be skipped without log.

Fixed before the commit (current `cli.DialPeerConn`): only the presence of `HARNESS_PROXY_VIA_RUNNER` triggers proxy mode; missing task_id surfaces as a loud error.

**Why it slipped (would have, if user hadn't pushed back)**: "Be defensive about both env vars" feels safer. It isn't — it converts a loud "you're misconfigured" into a silent "and now you're hitting a different network path than you expected".

**Mitigation — general principle:**

When you find yourself writing `if X && Y { useFeature }` for env / config gating, ask: what should happen if X is set but Y is missing? If the answer is "silent fallback", that's almost always wrong. Surface the misconfiguration explicitly instead.

---

## Pitfall 5 — Build-output / runtime-state collision in `make clean`

**What went wrong**: `make clean` was `rm -rf bin`. `bin/.run/` is the runtime state directory for `scripts/runner.sh` (slot pid / log / shutdown sentinel files). Live agent-runner processes kept their `--shutdown-file` path open across the delete; subsequent restart attempts via `scripts/build_and_restart_all.py` reported "no alive agent-runner slots under bin/.run/" because the orchestrator could no longer discover them.

Fixed in commit `fe62101` — `make clean` now removes only the four specific binary targets, preserving `bin/.run/`.

**Why it slipped**: `bin/.run/` was added to the project after `make clean` was written. No one re-audited the clean target.

**Mitigation — when adding state under an existing build-output directory:**

Audit `make clean` / `git clean` / build scripts for the new path. Better: don't co-locate runtime state with build output (this project should eventually move `bin/.run/` to `.run/` at repo root, but kept as-is to avoid a coordinated restart of all live runners).

---

## Pitfall 6 — `peer.Conn.Close()` sends wire-level Close, breaks relay setup

**What went wrong**: `runner/relay_handler.go`'s `completeRelaySetup` initially called `pc.Close()` after `SetProxy`. `peer.Conn.Close()` sends a `trsf.Close` wire message before tearing down — but that wire Close reached the SERVER's end-to-end relay conn (which shares the same CID through SetProxy) and caused `handleConnection` on the server to exit EOF prematurely, before the target runner's `RunnerHello` arrived.

Fixed in commit `101128d` — use `pc.Connection().Close()` (raw objproto-level close, no trsf Close message). The proxySettings entry survives, the activeConn entry is removed, packets keep being forwarded.

**Why it slipped**: Discovered only by the E2E integration test (`TestRelayE2E`). Unit tests didn't catch it.

**Mitigation — when working with `peer.Conn` and `objproto.Connection`:**

`peer.Conn.Close()` ≠ `pc.Connection().Close()`. The former sends a trsf.Close wire message (semantically "I'm leaving"); the latter tears down only the local activeConn state. For SetProxy-style relay setups, you almost always want the latter — sending wire Close would propagate through the proxy to peers you didn't mean to notify.

`peer.Conn.Close()` also has a load-bearing 50ms sleep for Windows scheduling (`project_peer_close_send_drain` in memory) — that's the other half of the same close-behavior surface.

---

## Pitfall 7 — Listen bind addr ≠ dial target addr

**What went wrong**: `HARNESS_PROXY_VIA_RUNNER` was set to literal `cfg.WSListen` (e.g. `"ws:0.0.0.0:8540-*"`). Agents on the same host tried to dial `0.0.0.0:8540` — accepted by Linux kernel as localhost, rejected by Windows / macOS. With `--listen :8540` (host empty) the agent got `ws::8540-*` which fails DNS lookup on every OS.

Fixed in commit `d26aa8d` — `rewriteProxyViaForLocalDial` normalizes the host portion to loopback when it's an unspecified bind address.

**Why it slipped**: Tested only on Linux. The cross-OS issue was theoretical until somebody actually ran it on Windows / macOS — at which point it's a confusing late failure.

**Mitigation — when generating addr strings for cross-host / cross-OS use:**

Distinguish bind addr (server-side, "listen on every interface" = 0.0.0.0) from dial addr (client-side, "where to reach this peer" = 127.0.0.1 / hostname / specific IP). Never use the bind addr as a dial target. If you're auto-deriving one from the other, write a rewrite step explicitly.

## Subagent dispatch checklist (controller-side)

When dispatching an implementer or reviewer subagent in this project, include in the prompt:

### Implementer prompt augmentations
- [ ] Quote the spec's **Problem statement** verbatim. Report which bullets the diff addresses; justify omissions.
- [ ] **Sibling-code grep**: before adding code to TUI/WebUI/server handlers, grep how adjacent files in the same layer invoke the same helper category. Match the existing pattern.
- [ ] Beware `peer.Conn.Close()` vs `pc.Connection().Close()` when working with relays.
- [ ] If gating a feature on multiple env vars, default to OR (presence of ANY signal triggers the feature, missing required complements surface as loud errors) — not AND with silent fallback.

### Reviewer prompt augmentations
- [ ] Read BOTH the Problem statement AND the Implementation section. Flag uncovered problem-statement bullets.
- [ ] Check layer-internal consistency: does this diff's caller pattern match adjacent code in the same layer?
- [ ] Check for silent fallback paths: if a config / env is set, does any combination cause it to be ignored without log?

## When to invoke this skill

- BEFORE running `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` for any task on this project
- BEFORE dispatching a fresh implementer or reviewer subagent
- BEFORE writing new code that touches: `cli.Dial*`, `peer.Conn.Close`, `transport.WebSocketEndpoint` mode handling, env injection for spawned processes, `HARNESS_PROXY_VIA_RUNNER`, `make clean`, or any helper that has `*With(client)` long-lived and `X(serverCID)` short-lived variants
